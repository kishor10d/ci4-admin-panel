# CodeIgniter 4 Admin Panel

## What is CodeIgniter 4 Admin Panel?

CodeIgniter 4 Admin Panel is simple, easily extendable admin panel might be used as CMS boilerplate for your small website, or backend panel for internal entries.

This project is basically built with CodeIgniter 3 initially, now we are trying to move this to CodeIgniter 4 for more advance development features.
